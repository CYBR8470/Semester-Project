# Project Summary
To fit the 4-5 week development timeline, our team decided to develop an online game of Yahtzee. It is a familiar game with an established rule set and object parameters. We will work to codify it in the context of a server that controls dice values, rule sets, and scoring, a game-hosting client, and game-joining clients. We felt this design would help us to provide clear examples of some of the concepts developed during the course.
