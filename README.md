# Project Summary
To fit the 4-5 week development timeline, our team decided to develop an online game of Yahtzee. It is a familiar game with an established rule set and object parameters. We will work to codify it in the context of a server that controls dice values, rule sets, and scoring, a game-hosting client, and game-joining clients. We felt this design would help us to provide clear examples of some of the concepts developed during the course. 

## Installation
Installing and running the yahtzee application locally requires some terminal use to get started.

### Required Software
In order to run the yahtzee application locally, you must have Docker and Docker-Compose installed on your local machine.
Once you have that installed, simply open a terminal window within the "project" folder, and then run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose build
```
After the project builds and is deployed locally, you should see text in the terminal window that says "Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/".
Once that appears, you can simply navigate to "http://localhost:8000" in your browser of choice to see the app running locally on your machine.
